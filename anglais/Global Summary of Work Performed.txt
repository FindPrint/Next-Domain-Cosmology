# 🚀 Global Summary of Work Performed

## 1. 📥 Data Loading and Preparation
- **Download of Pantheon+SH0ES files** from the official repository (catalog `.dat` and covariance matrices `.cov`).  
- **Reading SNe Ia data**:  
  - 1701 supernovae, with redshift `zHD` and observed distance modulus `MU_SH0ES`.  
- **Initial issue**: covariance files are provided in flattened form (2,893,402 lines).  
  - **Solution**: skip the first header line, then reshape into square matrices 1701×1701.

## 2. 🧮 Covariance Matrix Preparation
- **SPD correction**: symmetrization + eigenvalue regularization to ensure positive definiteness.  
- **Construction of a blended covariance**:  

$$
C_{\text{blend}} = \alpha \, C_{\text{corrected full}} + (1-\alpha)\, C_{\text{stat}}
$$

with $$\alpha = 0.8$$ (and later scanning multiple values of α).  
- Verification: minimum eigenvalues > 0 → matrices are well‑conditioned.

## 3. 🌌 Cosmological Model
- Definition of the luminosity distance model:  
  - Friedmann–Lemaître integral:  

$$
d_L(z) = \frac{c}{H_0}(1+z)\int_0^z \frac{dz'}{\sqrt{\Omega_m(1+z')^3 + (1-\Omega_m)}}
$$

  - Theoretical distance modulus:  

$$
\mu(z) = 5 \log_{10}(d_L(z)) + 25 + M
$$

- Free parameters: **H₀, Ωₘ, M**.

## 4. 📊 Likelihoods
- Two log‑likelihoods defined:  
  - `lnlike_tronque` → full corrected covariance.  
  - `lnlike_blend` → blended covariance.  
- Pre‑computations: covariance inverses and determinants to speed up evaluations.

---

## 5. 🔁 MCMC (Metropolis)
- Implementation of a simple but optimized MCMC (vectorized proposals).  
- Two chains launched:  
  - Truncated: 6000 steps (burn‑in 1000).  
  - Blend: 8000 steps (burn‑in 2000).  
- Results: posterior distributions of H₀, Ωₘ, M.  
- Verification: correct acceptance rates, statistical summaries (mean, median, intervals).

## 6. 📐 *Cosmics Tension* Metrics
Definition of four indicators to compare truncated vs blended runs:
- **Stability (S)**: median shift in units of σ.  
- **Persistence (P)**: fraction of overlap between credible intervals.  
- **Degeneracy (D)**: correlation between parameters (e.g. H₀–M).  
- **Robustness (R)**: global score combining S, P, D.

Typical results:
- **Ωₘ** → robust (R ≈ 0.86–0.90).  
- **H₀ and M** → fragile (R ≈ 0.1–0.4), highly degenerate with each other.

## 7. 🔄 α‑Scanning
- Loop over α = 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9.  
- For each α: recompute `C_blend`, run a fast MCMC, compute metrics.  
- Build a comparative table of R scores.

Observation:  
- Ωₘ remains stable and robust.  
- H₀ and M vary strongly with α, with a robustness peak around α=0.8.

---

## 8. 📈 Visualizations
- **R(α) curves**: robustness evolution for H₀, Ωₘ, M.  
- **Radar chart (α=0.8)**: direct comparison of the four metrics (S, P, D, R) for each parameter.  
- **Radar grid (α=0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9)**: multidimensional visualization of robustness evolution.

# ✨ Conclusion

A **complete and reproducible pipeline** has been built that:  
1. Loads and corrects Pantheon+SH0ES data.  
2. Defines a simple cosmological model (H₀, Ωₘ, M).  
3. Compares two covariance frameworks (truncated vs blend).  
4. Explores parameter stability via MCMC.  
5. Quantifies robustness with the *Cosmics Tension* metrics.  
6. Visualizes results with tables, curves, and radar plots.  

👉 In short: this demonstrates that **Ωₘ is robust**, while **H₀ and M are unstable and degenerate**, and that this fragility depends on the weight α assigned to the systematic covariance.
