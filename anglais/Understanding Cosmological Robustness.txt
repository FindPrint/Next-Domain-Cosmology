# üåå Understanding Cosmological Robustness with *Cosmics Tension*

## 1. The Starting Problem
In cosmology, we try to measure fundamental numbers that describe the Universe.  
Two of the most important are:
- **H‚ÇÄ**: the rate at which the Universe is expanding today (the famous ‚ÄúHubble constant‚Äù).  
- **Œ©‚Çò**: the proportion of matter in the Universe.  

The issue is that different methods give results that don‚Äôt agree, especially for H‚ÇÄ. This is known as the **Hubble tension**.

## 2. The Data Used
We rely on a large catalog of Type Ia supernovae (Pantheon+SH0ES).  
- These exploding stars serve as **cosmic beacons**: by measuring their brightness and distance, we can reconstruct the history of the Universe‚Äôs expansion.  
- The data come with covariance matrices, which describe uncertainties and correlations between measurements.

## 3. The Idea of the *Cosmics Tension* Pipeline
We want to test **how robust the results are** when we change how uncertainties are treated.  
- We compare two approaches:  
  - **Full covariance** (stricter, includes all sources of error).  
  - **Statistical‚Äëonly covariance** (simpler, excludes systematics).  
- We also mix the two with a parameter $$\alpha$$ (for example, 80% full covariance + 20% statistical).

## 4. How It Works
1. Define a simple model of the Universe (based on H‚ÇÄ, Œ©‚Çò, and a calibration parameter M).  
2. Fit this model to the data using a sampling method (MCMC) that explores all possible values.  
3. Compare the results obtained with the different covariances.

## 5. The Four Indicators
To measure robustness, we designed four easy‚Äëto‚Äëunderstand metrics:  
- **Stability (S)**: does the value change a lot when covariance changes?  
- **Persistence (P)**: do the confidence intervals overlap well?  
- **Degeneracy (D)**: are two parameters too tightly linked (e.g. H‚ÇÄ and M moving together)?  
- **Robustness (R)**: a global score combining the three above.

## 6. What We Find
- **Œ©‚Çò (matter)**: very robust. No matter the covariance, the result stays stable and reliable.  
- **H‚ÇÄ (expansion)** and **M (calibration)**: fragile.  
  - They change significantly depending on covariance.  
  - They are almost perfectly correlated ‚Üí hard to separate.  
  - Their robustness is low (R ‚âà 0.1‚Äì0.4).  
- When varying $$\alpha$$:  
  - Œ©‚Çò remains solid.  
  - H‚ÇÄ and M show a dip in robustness at $$\alpha = 0.7$$ and a rebound at $$\alpha = 0.8$$.

## 7. Visualizations
- **R(Œ±) curves**: show Œ©‚Çò stays high, while H‚ÇÄ and M oscillate.  
- **Radar charts**: make it clear at a glance that Œ©‚Çò is balanced, while H‚ÇÄ and M are ‚Äúflattened‚Äù by their instability.  

---

## 8. Conclusion
- The *Cosmics Tension* pipeline is a **toolbox** for testing the solidity of cosmological results.  
- It shows that:  
  - The matter fraction (Œ©‚Çò) is well measured and robust.  
  - The Hubble constant (H‚ÇÄ) is fragile, dependent on error treatment, and strongly tied to M.  
- The H‚ÇÄ tension is therefore not a simple bug: it is a real structural instability.

‚ú® In summary: this work makes visible what many suspected ‚Äî **some cosmological parameters are solid, others are fragile**, and it is important to state this clearly in order to move forward.
